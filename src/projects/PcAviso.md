bigDescription1: The Covid-19 tracker is a personal project I built to track cases in real time using the Covid-19 Greece response API. I took the decision to create the tracker because of the current situation. At the same time, I thought it would be a great exercise of my API implementation skills. The project took around two weeks to be completed.
bigDescription2: Covid-19 Tracker is the first Greek web app that shows statistics of Covid. There are plenty of websites that show worldwide data, but I decided to narrow down the data and create one specifically targeting regions of Greece.
infoDescription1: The tracker could be built only by using vanilla React, but I decided to code it with Gatsby, because it's super fast and a great exercise as well. As for the styling of it, Tailwind was my first option, but during the first build I noticed that some features would include extra styling, so eventually I picked SASS for its simplicity.
infoTitle1: Key features
infoDescription2: The first feature is divided in four sections displaying the overall cases, while under every block I display the daily stats. Following up with the cases per region where I filtered the query to display as first the region with most cases. Also, I included a graph where the visitor can see the case rates visually.
infoDescription3: The most complex feature of the tracker was the map. The circles drawn on the map are based on a mathematical equation relative to the number of cases and the range and circumference of the circle. The circle coordinates had to be connected with the API and placed on the map accordingly.
bigDescription3: Overall, the Covid-19 tracker broadened my view and skills dealing with APIs and helped me understand better when to use certain frameworks. Gave me ideas and inspiration to challenge my coding skills more.
