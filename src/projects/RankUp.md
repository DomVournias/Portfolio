bigDescription1: RankUp is a Greek web design and SEO agency I've created. It focuses on building websites with a structured SEO content plan and overall a search engine-optimized build. Rankup's target audience is Greek and it is divided up through Google - YouTube organic traffic.
infoDescription1: Performance is the key to content optimization and speed, which is why I selected the lightest page builder for Rankup, Gutenberg. I wanted to get that extra point in Google's page speed insights. Of course I've added an AMP version and made it responsive for all devices. I included few css lines in the build just to spice things up with an extra styling touch.
bigDescription2: Over the past three years I've managed several websites where their SEO rank was way off their true potential. I helped them reach a 10x of their incoming monthly traffic through on-page SEO and link building.
infoTitle1: Key features
infoDescription2: Most Wordpress plugins offer great design solutions, but with a cost of large files guys and that's very important because it affects loading speeds. Reducing the use of plugins can really change the SERP rank of landing pages and blog posts, and this is exactly the strategy I followed with Rankup.
bestFeature: The Forms
infoDescription3: The website has one CTA form where I offer a free SEO quote for potential clients and a contact form where I collect inquiries. Both of the forms are integrated with my personal email so I can receive notifications whenever someone messages Rankup, straight away in my phone.Overall the forms were not very complicated, because they haven't any multiple choice or payment gateways.
bigDescription3: As an agency or an e-education blog Rankup broadened my SEO skills in the Greek language in terms of keyword research and serp analysis. Learning what design and coding language works best for the search engines is very beneficial for me as well as the customer.
