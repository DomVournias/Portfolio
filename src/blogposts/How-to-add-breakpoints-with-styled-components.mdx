## How to use media queries with Styled Components

### Styled Components breakpoints

If you want to apply responsiveness to your app, you will have to use media queries. If you're using <ExLink goTo="https://styled-components.com/" label="Styled Components" /> and you don't know how to add the breakpoints correctly, I will show you how to do it.

### Create the media queries

Create a file in this case we will name it Breakpoints.styled.js and create an object with the breakpoint names you want to use and assign for each of the names a value that represents the screen size you want to use.

---

Then we create an object called device and we assign again the values for each breakpoint name, but this time with the media querie parameter _max-width_ or _min-width_ dependand on how you will style your application.

> From mobile to desktop use max-width

---

```javascript
// Breakpoints.styled.js

// Thsese are the sizes
export const size = {
  mobileS: "320px",
  mobileM: "375px",
  mobileL: "425px",
  tablet: "768px",
  laptop: "1024px",
  laptopL: "1440px",
  desktop: "2560px",
};

// These are the queries
export const device = {
  mobileS: `(max-width: ${size.mobileS})`,
  mobileM: `(max-width: ${size.mobileM})`,
  mobileL: `(max-width: ${size.mobileL})`,
  tablet: `(max-width: ${size.tablet})`,
  laptop: `(max-width: ${size.laptop})`,
  laptopL: `(max-width: ${size.laptopL})`,
  desktop: `(max-width: ${size.desktop})`,
  desktopL: `(max-width: ${size.desktop})`,
};
```

---

### Edit the styled element for the preferred breakpoint

Now that we have all the breakpoints and device sizes we can import it into our styled element.

---

---

- Classic CSS Media Queries

```css
@media (max-width: 1024px) {
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-items: flex-start;
}
```

---

> Make sure to import the `device` from where you set the media queries.

- Styled Components Media Queries

```css
  import { device } from "./Breakpoints.styled";

  @media ${device.laptop} {
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    align-items: flex-start;
  }

```

As you can see we add `device.` and then the preferred screen size, for example `laptop`.

---

There you have it, that simple we can have globally in our project whatever screen sizes we want our app to be responsive to.
