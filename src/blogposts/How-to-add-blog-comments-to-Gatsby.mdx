## Create a comments section to your Gatsby blog

### Link your Github account with Utterances

If you want to get a beatiful comment section in your Gatsby blog then follow the steps bellow, and you will easily have it ready in under 10 minutes.

---

First go to utterances page: <ExLink goTo="https://github.com/apps/utterances" label="Here" />

---

<GatsbyImage
  image={getImage(props.localImages[0])}
  alt="configure utterances"
  className="mb-8"
/>

Click configure and select one repository to be associated with your blog. Note that everytime someone posts a comment it will create a Github issue as a discussion to your selected repository.

---

<GatsbyImage
  image={getImage(props.localImages[1])}
  alt="link github with utterances"
  className="mb-8"
/>

> ‚ùóÔ∏è Make sure your repo is public so the app can access it.

### Create a comments component in your Gatsby blog

We need to add a comments component so we can add inside our post template.

---

```javascript
// Commments.js

import React, { useEffect } from "react";
const Comments = ({ issueTerm }) => {
  const commentsUUID = `comments_${issueTerm}`;
  useEffect(() => {
    let anchor;
    const theme = "github-light"; // you could choose other themes too
    const script = document.createElement("script");
    anchor = document.getElementById(commentsUUID);
    script.setAttribute("src", "https://utteranc.es/client.js");
    script.setAttribute("crossorigin", "anonymous");
    script.setAttribute("async", true);
    script.setAttribute("repo", "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME"); // change to your repo link
    script.setAttribute("issue-term", issueTerm);
    script.setAttribute("theme", theme);
    anchor.appendChild(script);
    return () => {
      anchor.innerHTML = "";
    };
  });
  return (
    <>
      <div id={commentsUUID} className="post-comments" className="relative">
        <div className="utterances-frame"></div>
      </div>
    </>
  );
};

export default Comments;
```

---

You can choose a theme here: _https://utteranc.es/_

---

<GatsbyImage
  image={getImage(props.localImages[2])}
  alt="choose a theme in utterance.es"
  className="mb-8"
/>

Now that we finished with the Comments component it's time to insert it in our Blog Post Template.

---

---

```javascript
// PostTemplate.js

import React from "react";
import Comments from "YOUR PATH";

const PostTemplate = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Comments issueTerm="{data.mdx.frontmatter.slug}" /> // You can assign the
      title or the slug
    </div>
  );
};

export default PostTemplate;
```

---

> ‚ùï It doesn't really matter if you assign your blog post title or slug as long as you can find it in your repository issues.

---

Here you can see we can have a beatiful comment section in a Gatsby blog in under 10 minutes.

---

<GatsbyImage
  image={getImage(props.localImages[3])}
  alt="configure utterances"
  className="mb-8"
/>

Now, if you leave a comment you will spot it in your issues section in Github.

---

<GatsbyImage
  image={getImage(props.localImages[4])}
  alt="configure utterances"
  className="mb-8"
/>

### Conclussion

It's very important to mention that you not only improving your SEO by using this solution, but you also helping the community. Sometimes people looking for answers through Github so this is a plus.

---

Also did I mention that your visitor will be able to style their comments with Markdown?
