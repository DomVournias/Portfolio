## Create a code block component

### Install Prism for MDX

We are going to use Prism so we can then go ahead and create the component. First install Prism

<Code code={`npm i prismjs`} language="javascript" />

<Code
  code={`yarn add gatsby-plugin-mdx-prismjs
`}
  language="javascript"
/>

<Code
  code={`yarn add @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/loader loader-utils --dev`}
  language="javascript"
/>

Include in _gatsby-config.js_

<Code
  code={`// gatsby-config.js
---
plugins: ['gatsby-plugin-mdx-prismjs'],`}
  language="javascript"
/>

You can read more about Prism <ExLink goTo="https://prismjs.com/" label="here"/>.

### Create the code block component

Create a new component and called it however you like. In this example I will call it _Code.js_

<Code
  code={`// Code.js
---
import React, { useEffect } from "react";
import Prism from "prismjs";
import "../../styles/prism.css";
---
export default function Code({ code, language }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    Prism.highlightAll();
  }, []);
  return (
    <div className="my-10">
      <div className="Code">
        <pre className={/* Inside template literals -> */language- $ {language} }>
          <code>{code}</code>
        </pre>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}`}
  language="javascript"
/>

### Style the code block component

Create a css file called _prism.css_ and make sure to import it in your code block component.

#### Choose a Prismjs theme

- Official Prism Themes <ExLink goTo="https://prismjs.com/" label="prismjs.com" />

- Community Themes <ExLink goTo="https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes" label="Github repo library" />

- Prismjs Theme Generator <ExLink goTo="http://k88hudson.github.io/syntax-highlighting-theme-generator/www/" label="Create your own theme" />

<Code
  code={`//prism.css
--- 
Prism Theme CSS`}
  language="javascript"
/>

### Insert code block component in MDX

To finalize we have to import the code component in our MDX file and start writing our code.

<Code
  code={`//YourPost.mdx
---
import Code from "./Code";
/*Content...*/
<Code code={/*code goes between template literals ''*/} languate="javascript"/>`}
  language="javascript"
/>

### Customizing the fonts of Prism block

If you've followed all the steps correctly then you'll have a prism code block exactly like mine except from the typography.

<GatsbyImage
  image={getImage(props.localImages[0])}
  alt="Customizing the fonts of Prism block"
  className="mb-8"
/>
<GatsbyImage
  image={getImage(props.localImages[1])}
  alt="Customizing the fonts of Prism block"
  className="mb-8"
/>

To add the typography you will have to include the font-styles in the correct css class inside _prism.css_ file.

<Code
  code={`//prism.css
---
/*Tokens*/
.token.string,
.token.comment {
  font-family: Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, "Andale Mono", "Ubuntu Mono",
    "Courier New", monospace;
}
`}
  language="css"
/>

<Break />

## Conclussion

You can customize your prism code blocks to suit your style with the tools I mentioned above and further expand the functionality of the component.
