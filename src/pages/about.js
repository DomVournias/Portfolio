          I'm Dom â€“ a blend of artistry and coding. 
          Let me take you through my journey.
        </p>
        
        <p className="about-paragraphs">
         Back when I was 15, I jumped into creating Tumblr themes with HTML and CSS, just for kicks. 
          And sometimes, I'd toss in some JavaScript here and there to spice things up.
        </p>
        
        <p className="about-paragraphs">
          As time rolled on, my path led me to study Fine Arts
          and later on Film Production. But here's the kicker: the coding bug
          never really left me.
        </p>
        
        <p className="about-paragraphs">
          Life had other plans for me, and in 2017, I found myself
          circling back to coding, this time taking it professionally.
          It's been quite the journey, and I'm excited to keep painting this canvas with code.
        </p>
        
        <p className="about-paragraphs">
          So here I am, a creative coder on a quest to blend
          art and technology in captivating ways.
          Thanks for joining me on this ride!
