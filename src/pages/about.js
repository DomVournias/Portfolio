          My name is Rick. I'm a designer and developer from The Netherlands.
          I'm a father of 2. I love being in the outdoors; fishing, hiking and
          mountainbiking are some of the things I do to clear my mind and relax.
        </p>
        <p className="about-paragraphs">
          I've been a designer and developer for over 20 years now. In the past,
          Iâ€™ve coded in a lot of different languages like ObjC, Swift, PHP,
          Java, C#. Iâ€™m currently focusing on designing 3D graphics using Cinema
          4D and building applications using Javascript/React.

        <p className="about-paragraphs">
          The project I'm the most proud of is Flitsmeister, which started as an
          app I built with Sjoerd and Jorn to prevent us from getting speeding
          tickets. It's now a profitable business and has over 1.800.000 active
          users in The EU.

          Being able to both design and develop is a lot of fun. When you have
          an idea, thereâ€™s nothing holding you back from building it.
