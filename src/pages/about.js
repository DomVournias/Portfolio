         I'm Dom, and my story is a mashup of art and coding. 
          Back when I was 16, I got into making Tumblr themes using HTML and CSS, just for kicks. 
          I'd mess around with the code, throw in some JavaScript here and there to jazz things up. It was all part of the fun!

          I got involved in several big projects in the past, but the one that I
          am most proud of is H.I.C.D. It's a non-profit institute which I was

          I've studied Fine Arts and later on I moved to England to study Film
          Production. From a very young age I was very passionate about painting
          and arts in general.

          Having an artistic background helps me everyday in my work. It boosts
          and speeds up my designs, because I trained and developed an artistic
          perspective over the years.
